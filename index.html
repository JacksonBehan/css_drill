      <h2>NFL Football</h2>
      <p>I love the NFL and I am a die hard Philadelphia Eagles
        fan. Yes I am from New York but my dad was born and raised in Philly so I was raised to bleed green. Though now retired, my favorite player of all time is number 20, Brian Dawkins.</p>

      <h2>Movies, Music and TV</h2>
      <p>I am a big movie buff, some of my all time favorites are Fight Club,
        Goodfellas, A Clockwork Orange and Resevoir Dogs.
        I actually don't watch too many TV shows but Breaking Bad might be the best thing ever created, television or film so I have to give that a shout out.<br> 
        I also love music. Some of my favorite bands are Radiohead, The Killers, Linkin Park and Alt. J</p>

      <h2>Poker</h2>
      <p>My final passion is poker, specifically no limit texas hold em. It is
        such a great game, and there is so much more to it than the average
        person might think. It really is a game of skill and strategy, it's 
        like a chess match. Playing your opponent is just as important as the cards, in some cases more. I played for a living for about a year and a half but I was traveling hours each way to get to casinos from where I live and it just got to be too much. Poker will definitely be something I will always work at though.</p>
